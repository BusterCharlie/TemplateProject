# Dev Folder

This folder is excluded from version control and is intended for:

- **Testing files**: Temporary test scripts and data files
- **Experiments**: Code experiments and prototypes
- **Sandbox**: Files for trying out new features
- **Local development**: Developer-specific files and configurations

## Usage

Feel free to create any files or folders here without worrying about cluttering the main project structure. Everything in this folder is automatically ignored by git.

## Common use cases:

- `test_script.py` - Quick testing scripts
- `sample_data/` - Test data files
- `experiments/` - Feature prototypes
- `notes.md` - Development notes and TODOs

This folder helps maintain a clean project structure while providing space for development work.
